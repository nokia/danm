# Build script to create DANM container images.
#
# This script supports the following environment variables:
#
# - `TAG_PREFIX`. A string that will be prepended to all
#   built image tags. This can, for example, be a registry
#   name. Note that the string is prepended without any additional
#   separators, so if it is eg. a registry name, it MUST end with
#   a "/".
#
# - `EXTRA_BUILD_ARGS`. Any additional arguments that you want to
#   provide to the container build.
#
# - `USE_CACHE`. If defined, use cache during image build process.
#   For compativility with earlier versions of the build process,
#   the default is to NOT use the cache.
#
# - `KEEP_BUILDER`. If defined, keep the builder image and tag
#   it. This can be useful if the image is to be re-used for
#   unit testing, or if a developer wants to run an instance
#   off the builder image as a work environment.
#
# - `IMAGE_PUSH`. If defined, push images to registry right
#   after building.
