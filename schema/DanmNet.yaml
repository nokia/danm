### K8s DanmNet template ###
apiVersion: danm.k8s.io/v1
# This is a 3rd party addition to a K8s cluster.
# A DamnNet object represents a physical network together with its resources and configuration applications can use.
# The DANM will always connect K8s pods to K8s DanmNets.
kind: DanmNet
metadata:
  # Name of the K8s DanmNet object this file represents
  # MANDATORY - STRING
  name: ## DANMNET_NAME  ##
  # The K8s namespace the network belongs to.
  # MANDATORY - STRING
  namespace: ## NS_NAME  ##
spec:
  # This parameter will be used in application description templates for referring to a desired connection point
  # Currently this parameter shall exactly match with the name of DanmNet object itself
  # The parameter also configures which CNI configuration file is to be used if NetworkType points to a static-level CNI backend
  # MANDATORY - STRING
  NetworkID: ## NETWORK_NAME  ##
  # This parameter, if present, denotes which backend willl be used to provision the container interfaces connected to this network.
  # Currently supported values with dynamic integration level are IPVLAN (default), SRIOV, or MACVLAN.
  # - IPVLAN option results in an IPVLAN sub-interface provisioned in L2 mode, and connected to the designated host device
  # - SRIOV option pushes a pre-allocated Virtual Function of the configured host device to the container's netns
  # - MACVLAN option results in a MACVLAN sub-interface provisioned in bridge mode, and connected to the designated host device
  # For any other CNI backend DANM reads their configuration from the configured CNI config directory (value of "CNI_CONF_DIR" environment variable, default is "/etc/cni/net.d")
  # E.g. a Pod connecting to a DanmNet with "NetworkType" set to "bridge", and "NetworkID" set to "example_network" gets an interface provisioned by the <CONFIGURED_CNI_PATH_IN_KUBELET>/bridge binary based on the <CNI_CONF_DIR>/example_network.conf file
  # The default IPVLAN backend is used when this parameter is not specified.
  # OPTIONAL - ONE OF {ipvlan,sriov,macvlan,<NAME_OF_ANY_STATIC_LEVEL_CNI_COMPLIANT_BINARY>}
  # DEFAULT VALUE: ipvlan
  NetworkType: ## BACKEND_TYPE ##
  # Specific extra configuration options can be passed to the network provisioning backends.
  # Most of the parameters are only supported for level dynamic level backends, such as IPVLAN, MACVLAN, and SRIOV.
  # Other network interfaces are always provisioned based on static CNI configuration files.
  # The exceptional attributes are "rt_tables", "container_prefix", and "routes". DANM generally supports the features related to these parameters for all CNI backends.
  Options:
    # Name of the parent host device (i.e. physical host NIC).
    # Sub-interfaces are connected to this NIC in case NetworkType is set to IPVLAN, or MACVLAN.
    # Only has an effect with dynamically integrated backends. Ignored for other NetworkTypes.
    # Also ignored for SR-IOV, as the pre-allocated VF belonging to the configured Kubernetes Device pool is pushed into the connecting Pod's network namespace, regardless which Physical Funtion it belongs to.
    # OPTIONAL - STRING
    host_device: ## PARENT_DEVICE_NAME ##
    # Name of a network Device Plugin resource pool
    # The device_pool parameter generally represents the base resource name of the Kubernetes Devices connected to this network.
    # Specifically for DanmNets with "NetworkType: sriov" this option is mandatory, and it represents the K8s Virtual Function Device pool connecting Pods are getting their VFs from.
    # OPTIONAL - STRING
    device_pool: ## DEVICE_PLUGIN_RESOURCE_POOL_MAME ##
    # The IPv4 CIDR notation of the subnet associated with the network.
    # Pods connecting to this network will get their IPv4 IP from this subnet, if defined.
    # Only has an effect with dynamically integrated backends. Ignored for other NetworkTypes.
    # OPTIONAL - IPv4 CIDR FORMAT (e.g. "10.0.0.0/24")
    cidr: ## SUBNET_CIDR ##
    # IPv4 allocation will be done according to the narrowed down allocation pool parameter, if defined.
    # Allocation pool must be provided together with "cidr", and shall be included in the subnet range.
    # Only has an effect with dynamically integrated backends. Ignored for other NetworkTypes.
    # If CIDR is provided without defining an allocation pool, it is automatically calculated for the whole netmask (minus the first, and the last IP).
    # When the network administrator sets the allocation pool, DANM assumes the non-usable IPs (e.g. broadcast IP etc.) were already discounted.
    allocation_pool:
      start: ## FIRST_ASSIGNABLE_IP ##
      end: ## LAST_ASSIGNABLE_IP ##
    # The IPv6 CIDR notation of the subnet associated with the network.
    # Pods connecting to this network will get their IPv6s from this subnet, if defined.
    # Only has an effect with dynamically integrated backends. Ignored for other NetworkTypes.
    # OPTIONAL - IPv6 CIDR FORMAT (e.g. "2001:db8::/45"). Netmask of the subnet cannot be higher than /64 (i.e. /65 and upwards).
    net6: ## SUBNET_CIDR ##
    # Interfaces connected to this network are renamed inside the Pod's network namespace to a string starting with "container_prefix".
    # If not provided, DANM uses "eth" as the prefix.
    # In both cases DANM dynamically suffixes the interface names in Pod instantiation time with a unique integer number, corresponding to the sequence number of the interface during the specific network creation operation.
    # Thus it becomes guaranteed no network interfaces will ever receive the same name, even if more than one belongs to the same DanmNet.
    # Generally supported parameter, works with all NetworkTypes (except where the CNI backend itself is not following the CNI standard, such is the case with Flannel).
    # OPTIONAL - STRING
    container_prefix: ## INTERNAL_IF_NAME ##
    # Policy-based IP routes belonging to this network are installed into this routing table, when a user defines them in her Pod's network allocation annotation.
    # Generally supported parameter, works with all NetworkTypes.
    # OPTIONAL - INTEGER (e.g. 201)
    rt_tables: ## HOST_UNIQUE_ROUTING_TABLE_NUMBER ##
    # IPv4 routes to be installed into the default routing table of all Pods connected to this network.
    # Generally supported parameter, works with all NetworkTypes.
    # Note: some CNI backends, like Flannel might provision IP routes into the default routing table of a Pod on their own.
    # Beware of clashes.
    # OPTIONAL - LIST OF DESTINATION_IPV4_CIDR:IPV4_GW ENTRIES (e.g. "10.20.0.0/24: 10.0.0.1")
    routes:
      ## IP_ROUTE_1 ##
      ## IP_ROUTE_2 ##
    # IPv6 routes to be installed into the default routing table of all Pods connected to this network.
    # Generally supported parameter, works with all NetworkTypes.
    # OPTIONAL - LIST OF DESTINATION_IPV6_CIDR:IPV6_GW ENTRIES
    routes6:
      ## IP_ROUTE_1 ##
      ## IP_ROUTE_2 ##
    # When this parameter is present, traffic flowing through the connected network interfaces is VxLAN tagged with the provided virtual ID.
    # The VxLAN tag shall be unique on the level of the underlying host.
    # Management of the VxLAN interface is handled automatically by DANM. Provisioning is generally supported for all NetworkTypes.
    # Only IPVLAN, and MACVLAN interfaces are automatically connected to the provisioned VxLAN VTEP though.
    # VLAN and VxLAN paramaters are mutually exclusive! Defining both in the same DanmNet will result in a validation error!
    # OPTIONAL - INTEGER (e.g. 50)
    vxlan: ## VXLAN_TAG ##
    # When this parameter is present, traffic flowing through the connected network interfaces is VLAN tagged with the provided identifier.
    # The VLAN ID shall be unique on the level of the underlying host.
    # Management of the VLAN interface is handled automatically by DANM. Provisioning is generally supported for all NetworkTypes.
    # Only dynamically supported NetworkType interfaces are automatically VLAN tagged though.
    # VLAN and VxLAN paramaters are mutually exclusive! Defining both in the same DanmNet will result in a validation error!
    # OPTIONAL - INTEGER (e.g. 4000)
    vlan: ## VLAN_TAG ##
